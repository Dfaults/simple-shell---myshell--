<help shell>
The Shell or Command Line Interpreter is the fundamental user interface to an Operating System. 
The shell:
   * interprets the input,
   * takes appropriate action, and
   * finally prompts for more input.
The shell can be used either
   * as interactively - enter commands at the command prompt,
or
   * as an interpreter to execute a shell script.
#

Code of shell is writen in 'straight' C using the compiler of gcc.

Type "help [command]" to get the detail usage of each command.

<help bat> <help batchfile>
*********************************************************************
************************* batch file support ************************
*********************************************************************
myshell is able to take its command line input from a batchfile. 
i.e. if the shell is invoked with a command line argument:
e.g.   myshell test.bat
then the batchfile -- test.bat -- is assumed to contain a set of command lines for the shell to process. 
When the end of file is reached, the shell should exit. 
Obviously, if the shell is invoked without a command line argument,
it solicits input from the user via a prompt on the display.
See also "help myshell".

<help i/o redirection> <help I/O Redirection> <help io redirection>
******************************************************************
************************ I/O Redirection *************************
******************************************************************
myshell supports i/o-redirection on either or both stdin(standard input) and/or stdout(standard output). i.e. the command line:
e.g.   programname arg1 arg2 <inputfile >outputfile
this will execute the program programname with arguments arg1 and arg2,
the stdin FILE stream replaced by inputfile and the stdout FILE stream replaced by outputfile. 
The file can be given by the full path as:
    /home/username/test.txt
As to the file path format, type "help path" to get more information.

Input redirection --i.e. stdin redirection-- is possible for the internal commands: cd, dir, echo.
Output redirection --i.e. stdout redirection-- is possible for the internal commands: dir, environ, echo, help, pwd.

<help redirection> 
   * when the redirection token is < then the inputfile is opened if it exists, or a "Path Error" wil be reported in the screen.
     e.g.      cd  <test.txt 
   * when the redirection token is > then the outputfile is created if it does not exist and truncated if it does.
    e.g.      ls   >test.txt
   * when the redirection token is >> then outputfile is created if it does not exist and appended to if it does.
     e.g.    environ  >>test.txt
Sometimes you can use more than one token to open several files as input or/and  output.
    e.g.   echo  <m.txt >n.txt
             dir  >m.txt >n.txt 
If the file cannot opened due to read permission or write permission, an "Open Error" wil be reported in the screen.

<help background execution> <help background>
******************************************************************
************************ Background Execution ******************
********************************************************************
Normally, when a command is execution, you have to wait for the completion and type another command. Especially, when the comand is executed from a batchfile, much time is wasted in waiting. Background execution allows you not to wait for the execution. An ampersand (&) at the end of the command line indicates that the shell should execute the command in background. 
myshell supports background execution of programs. An ampersand (&) at the end of the command line indicates that the shell should return to the command line prompt immediately after launching that program.

******************* Detail usage of each command **************
*******************************************************************

<help cd>
Format:    cd [directory]
-- change the current default directory to [directory].
   e.g.    cd /home
   This command also change the PWD environment variable (use the command "pwd" to see it).
   As to the directory path, type "help path" to get more information.
   If the [directory] argument is not present, report the current directory.
   If the directory does not exist, a "Path Error" wil be reported in the screen.
   Moreover, you can use a directory path writen in a file as:
   e.g.    cd <test.txt
   The file can be given by the full path as:
           cd </home/username/test.txt
   As to the file path format, type "help path" to get more information.
#

<help clr> <help clear>
Format:    clr
or         clear
-- clear the screen, no arguments is needed.

<help dir>
Format:    dir [directory] 
-- list the contents of directory [directory]
   e.g.   dir  /home
   This command  is different from "cd", it change neither the current default directory nor the PWD environment variable(use the command "pwd" to see it).

   If the [directory] argument is not present, list the contents of the current directory. If the directory does not exist, a "Path Error" wil be reported in the screen.

   Moreover, you can use a directory path writen in a file as:

   You can use both input redirection and output redirection as:
   e.g.   dir <a.txt >b.txt >c.txt
